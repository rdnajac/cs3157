# Makefiles

Make is a UNIX utility that helps you compile programs by following a blueprint
you specify.

Calling `make` will first automatically search your current directory for a
file called `Makefile`. Then, Make will use it to call various shell commands,
according to the rules outlined therein. This allows you to chain together
complex sequences of commands you would use to compile a program.

In other words, you can execute all the preprocessing, compiling, and linking
commands just by typing `make`. It's also a handy way to automate cumbersome
tasks, like cleaning up build products.

## The `myadd` `Makefile` in 10 Steps

In this repository, you'll find a directory named `myadd-demo`, which contains
an interactive, step-by-step demo which shows you how to create a simple
Makefile from scratch. You may use the `./demo` to step through different
versions of the `Makefile`, and use it to run `make` during each step. You may
also inspect the `Makefile`s for each step under `myadd-demo/Makefiles`.

This guide will follow the demo and explain what's happening with the `Makefile`
at each step.

If you prefer to just see a completed, annotated `Makefile`, you can check out
the [`sample-Makefile`](sample-Makefile) in this directory. Note that it does
not use all the features touched upon in this guide, but is sufficient for the
entire 3157 course.

You may also explore the [`practice`](practice) directory for some practice with
`Makefile`s.

### Introduction

#### Source code

Before we get started, let's (re)familiarize ourselves with the files we're
compiling:

##### `myadd.h`

This is where the function prototype for the `add()` function is declared.
It tells the compiler that somewhere in the final program, we'll have an
implementation of the `add()` function, with the given type signature.
If you're familiar with Java, you can think of this as something like a Java
`interface` (though without the notion of a class).

##### `myadd.c`

This is where the `add()` function is actually implemented. Note that this
`#include`s `myadd.h` because we want to make sure that the compiler knows which
`add()` function we're implementing, and so that it can check that we're using
the right type signature.

##### `main.c`

This is where we call the `add()` function, and print its result. We `#include`
`myadd.h` because we're calling a function that we haven't implemented in this
`.c` file (also called a compilation unit).

#### Compilation

Recall that there are three actions we need to perform in order to build `main`:

    gcc -g -Wall -c myadd.c         # compiles myadd.c => myadd.o
    gcc -g -Wall -c main.c          # compiles main.c => main.o
    gcc -g main.o myadd.o -o main   # links main.o and myadd.o => main

We use the `-g` and `-Wall` flags to include debugger symbols and enable all
compiler warnings. The `-o` flag specifies that the resulting file shall be
named as the argument after it, `main`.

### Step 0

First, let's get the `Makefile` building just one thing. To do so, we write a
**rule** to build a **target**. The syntax of a Makefile is as follows:

    [target]: [dependencies...]
        [shell command]
        ...

This says that to build `target`, we must first satisfy the one or more
`dependencies` that come after the `:`. Then, once dependencies are satisfied,
we build the target with one or more shell commands.

_Note that before the shell command you must use a TAB character (and not just
4 or 8 spaces). Make sure your text editor is aware of this if you've configured
it to expand your tabs._

Let's write our rule to build `myadd.o`, from `myadd.c`:

    myadd.o: myadd.c myadd.h
        gcc -g -Wall -c myadd.c

Note that just because a file is a dependency doesn't mean that it actually
needs to be used in the build command. We don't need to tell `gcc` about
`myadd.h` because the `#include` preprocessor macro handles that for us. But
we still need to let Make know that it should rebuild `myadd.o` if updates are
made to either `myadd.c` or `myadd.h`, which is why we specify `myadd.h` as a
dependency.

With this as the only thing our `Makefile`, if we run `make`, we'll see that
`myadd.o` is built for us!

### Step 1

Now, let's also write the rule for building `main.o`. Since `main.c` also
`#include`s `myadd.h`, we should also specify that as a dependency:

    main.o: main.c myadd.h
        gcc -g -Wall -c main.c

Now, what happens when you type `make` will depend on _where_ you've written
this rule. If `make` is given no arguments, it will just build the first target
that is explicitly specified in the `Makefile`. In the demo, we've written the
`main.o` rule above the `myadd.o` rule, so if you type `make` now, you should
see only `main.o` building.

We can still build targets that aren't the default (top) target. If we wanted
to explicitly tell Make to build `myadd.o`, we can run `make myadd.o`.

### Step 2

Time to link! Let's put our linking rule at the very top, to make sure it's the
default target when we run `make`:

    main: main.o myadd.o
        gcc -g main.o myadd.o -o main

Note that we did not specify `myadd.h` as a dependency. That's because linking
doesn't need this header file at all. `main` will still be rebuilt if `myadd.h`
is updated, but because it implicitly inherits this dependency from its own
dependencies, `main.o` and `myadd.o`.

Now that we have a more complex `Makefile`, we can dig deeper into what it means
for a target to "depend" on others. Recall that every file in UNIX has a
"last modified" timestamp, which is updated any time the file is changed or
`touch`ed. A target is built only if it does not exist, or if one or more of its
dependencies have a later timestamp than it. The reason Make does this rather
than rebuilding the entire program from scratch is because for large software
projects, rebuilding from scratch every time can be very inefficient. Instead,
Make just rebuilds outdated targets as necessary.

### Step 3

It's sometimes useful to clean up your project directory and get rid of all
your build products. In this case, the `main` executable and any `.o` files.
If we built anything by hand, we may also have produced an executable named
`a.out`, which we'll want to get rid of too. We can do that with the following:

    rm -rf main *.o a.out

We want to sure `rm` just does what its told (and doesn't choke on, say, some
directory mischieviously named `main`), so we pass it the `-rf` flag.
But having to type this all the time can be pretty cumbersome.

It turns out that Make targets don't have to be files! We can create a shortcut
for ourselves with the following rule:

    clean:
        rm -rf main *.o a.out

Now we can just clean up our project by running `make clean`. Isn't that neat?

### Step 4

Actually, there's a problem with the `Makefile` we left off with from step 3.
Consider the following sequence of commands:

    $ make
    gcc -g -Wall -c main.c
    gcc -g -Wall -c myadd.c
    gcc -g main.o myadd.o -o main
    $ touch clean
    $ make clean
    make: `clean' is up to date.

If you run `ls` now, you'll find that nothing has been cleaned. You'll also find
a file named `clean`, that was created by the `touch clean` command. Because
this file already exists, and its timestamp is not older than any of its
dependencies (since it has none), Make will not try to "build" the `clean`
target.

This kind of situation doesn't happen very often, but can be very frustrating
when it does. To get around it, we need to tell Make that this is a "phony"
target, using the special `.PHONY` directive, so that it ignores the timestamp
and runs the `clean` target every time:

    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
        rm -rf main *.o a.out

### Interlude

At this point, you now have the basis complete `Makefile`. You can jump to this
part of the demo by running:

    ./demo explicit

Every target in here is explicit, which means for larger software projects,
you'll be doing a _lot_ of typing. But as you'll soon find out, Make is powerful
enough to do some of the thinking for you, and save you from doing busy work.

In the following sections, we'll be explaining some of the fancier things you
can do with your Makefile by leveraging variables, implicit rules, and other
nifty features.

### Step 5

Make actually comes with a lot of the same features as shell scripting languages
like Bash and Python. One of these is the ability to assign variables.

Notice that every time compile, we use the same `-g -Wall` flags (in addition to
the `-c` flag). It doesn't seem like a big deal now, but if we were compiling
hundreds of compilation units and wanted to remove the `-Wall` flag from all of
them, that could get really annoying. (More annoying than those pesky warnings
you're trying to silence! But please leave in the `-Wall` flag for this class,
it's a good habit make.)

Instead, we add one more level ofindirection by assigning those flags to a
compiler flags variable instead:

    CFLAGS = -g -Wall

Now, in our rules, Make will substitute any instance of `$(CFLAGS)` it comes
across with `-g -Wall`. For example:

    gcc $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

We can do the same with the compiler command itself, `gcc`, as well as the `-g`
flag we're passing to the linking rule:

    CC = gcc
    LDFLAGS = -g

`CC` stands for "C Compiler," and `LDFLAGS` means "linking flags." Now we can
compile and link with the following:

    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c
    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) main.o myadd.o -o main

Now we can easily swap out the compiler and linking flags for our entire project
by modifying the build variables we've defined at the top of our `Makefile`.

It's not entirely obvious yet why we chose to substitute these particular parts
of our build commands, or why we're using such particular variable names. Why
this is important will become clear in step 8 when we use implicit rules.

### Step 6

**Step 6 and step 7 reference special symbols that are beyond the scope of 3157.
This tutorial only uses them to explicitly notate the intuitions behind the
implicit rules. You may skip directly to step 8 to avoid getting caught up in
the details.**

In the rule to build `main`, the shell command takes an argument of `-o main`,
which tells `gcc` to name the output executable `main`. What if we just wanted
to name it whatever the name of our target is?

Make also provides special variables whose values are dependent on the rule in
which they appear. They can be invoked using a `$` followed by a special
character. You won't need to know any of these for the purposes of this course,
but they provide useful notation to understand how implicit rules work.

The special variable that is substituted with the name of the target is `$@`.
We can rewrite the linking rule as follows:

    main: main.o myadd.o
        $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) main.o myadd.o -o $@

Within the `main` rule, `$@` will expand to `main`. Now, if we change `main`,
the output executable name will change accordingly.

You can try this out by playing around with your Makefile, then running `make`.

### Step 7

We can use a couple more special variables to eliminate some of the filenames
we explicitly reference in the shell commands for each rule.

First, we can use `$^`, which will be substituted with every dependency of the
target. We can use this for the `main` target once again:

    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $^ -o $@

Make also provides a special variable which will expand to only the first
dependency of a target, `$<`. This is especially handy for the compilation
rules:

    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Notice that at this point, the build commands in our `Makefile` don't explicitly
mention anything about the target they're building or the dependencies they're
using. For example, there's no mention of `main.o`, `main.c`, or `myadd.h` in
`main.o`'s build commands. There's probably another opportunity to simplify our
`Makefile` even more just around the corner...

### Step 8

The guys who wrote Make also realized that there are some pretty common patterns
when it comes to compiling C software projects, so they built the ability to
recognize these patterns into Make. These are what we call "**implicit rules**."

The built-in implicit rules will use the file extensions of the targets and
dependencies to infer what build command pattern to invoke. It will then fill in
build command automatically, which will be looking for extra configuration
options like compiler flags from specially designated build variables.

Specifically, the built-in C implicit rules will look for build variables such
as `CC`, `CFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS`... which we've already defined for ourselves!
They will also use the dependencies you've listed to figure what needs to be
compiled, what needs to be linked, and what needs to be used as the output name.
So we can just go ahead and remove the build commands, and just write the
targets and dependencies on their own:

    main: main.o myadd.o
    main.o: main.c myadd.h
    myadd.o: myadd.c myadd.h

This will still build -- try running `make` to see for yourself. For larger
software projects, implicit rules like these can go a long way.

### Step 9

There's something else that the Make developers realized about the file naming
conventions we use for C software projects: the name of the build target is
often related to that of one of its dependencies. For example, `myadd.o` comes
from `myadd.c`, and `main` comes from `main.o`.

If you omit those dependencies, Make will look for them any way and use them
during the compilation process. Thus we end up with a set of incredibly terse
build rules:

    main: myadd.o
    main.o: myadd.h
    myadd.o: myadd.h

And this _still_ builds.

There's a lot more fancy stuff you can do with your `Makefile`, but they're
beyond the scope of this class, and certainly beyond the scope of our toy
`myadd` software project. You can check out GNU's [Make manual][man-make] online
to find out the full extent of what this utility can do.

## Other Useful Make Variables

### Compiling with Libraries

The `Makefile` is a great way to manage how your software project interacts with
other libraries. As you'll learn later, you'll need to pass extra flags to `gcc`
in order for it to be aware of where the library files are. It's a common
pattern for `Makefile`s to incorporate these flags while invoking implicit
rules.

#### `INCLUDES`

In order to tell `gcc` where to search for non-standard header files, you pass
it the `-I` flag during compilation (but not linking). This can be passed in
alongside `CFLAGS`, but you'll often see the following pattern:

    INCLUDES = -Imy/include/path
    CFLAGS = -g -Wall $(INCLUDES)

We create a separate `INCLUDES` variable to distinguish between include paths
and other compilation flags, but we pass it along with the `CFLAGS`.

#### `LDLIBS`

After everything is compiled, you'll need to link your project against a library
where the library functions and variables are located. This is done using the
`-l` flag. However, unlike with `INCLUDES`, we can't just stow away our `-l`
flags alongside our `LDFLAGS`, because order does matter when you're linking.

Thankfully, Make's implicit rules take this into account, and give us a separate
build variable we can use. The `LDLIBS` variable comes after the `.o` files,
while the `LDFLAGS` comes before. The full implicit rule actually looks
something like this:

    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $@

If you haven't assigned anything to `LDLIBS`, `$(LDLIBS)` will just silently
disappear when it's expanded. We can use the implicit build variables like this:

    LDFLAGS = -g -Lmy/libary/path
    LDLIBS = -lmylib

### Compiling C++

When we compile C++ programs later on, we'll need a different compiler, though
most of how it works is very similar. Specifically, we'll be using `g++`.
We still need to compile and link in separate stages, and will still need to
pass each stage compiler and linking flags.

#### `CXX`

When compiling C++ `.cpp` files, the implicit rule will look for `CXX` instead
of `CC`, so we can make sure it uses the right compiler by doing the following:

    CXX = g++

#### `CXXFLAGS`

Make will also expect a separate build variable for compiling C++, `CXXFLAGS`.
If we just want to have `g++` use the same flags as when compiling C, we can
use the following trick:

    CXXFLAGS = $(CFLAGS)

`$(CFLAGS)` can be followed by any number of C++-specific flags.

The implicit rule for compiling C++ programs looks something like the following:

    $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $<

You may want to revisit these notes once you begin writing C++ programs later in
the semester.

## Common Make Practices

### More `.PHONY` Targets

Make can be used for a lot more than just building files. As with `make clean`,
we can use it as a repository for commands that we would commonly use during
the development process.

#### `all`

Sometimes, you might want to clean up everything and build everything from
scratch. The target conventionally used for this is `all`. Its rule is usually
written as follows:

    .PHONY: all
    all: clean main

`main` should be replaced with whatever your default build target is.

The reason this works is because Make satisfies dependencies from left to right.
So, running `make all` will first run `make clean`, then run `make main`.
Since no build commands are specified underneath, Make will not do anything
after satisfying `clean` and `main`.

#### `TARGETS` and `default`

When you're building multiple targets, it can be useful to have a single
variable to keep track of them. For example, if we're building two executables,
`foo` and `bar`, alongside `main`, we would write the following at the top of my
`Makefile`:

    TARGETS = main foo bar

Then, in order to build all of these by default, we would write the topmost rule
as a `.PHONY` rule:

    .PHONY: default
    default: $(TARGETS)

Now we can build `main`, `foo`, and `bar` all at once by just typing `make`!

Make sure that `clean` is aware of all of the `TARGETS`, not just `main`:

    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
        rm -rf $(TARGETS) *.o a.out

#### `test`

The `Makefile` can also be a handy place to stash test commands, especially ones
that are really cumbersome to type. Later on, you may find yourself running
the following quite often:

    valgrind --leak-check=yes ./myprogram arg1 arg2

Instead of having to type all that out, we can just write the following in our
`Makefile`:

    test: default
        valgrind --leak-check=yes ./myprogram arg1 arg2

Now, we can just test our code with `make test`!
